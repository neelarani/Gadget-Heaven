## List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project

1. Components: Building blocks of a React application , either class-based or
   functional , that defined the UI and behavior.

2.JSX: Syntax extention that allows writing HTML like code within javascript,
used to defined the component structure,

3. Props: short for propertiess, used to pass data from parent to child
   components.

4. state: A way to manage dynamic data within a component , making it
   interactive.

5. useState HOOk: a hook used for side effects like fetching data, subscribing
   to events , or modifying the DOM.

6. conditional rendaring: rendaring different UI elements based on certain
   conditions .

7. react router: provides navigation and routing within a react application
   useing components like route, Link, NavLink.

8. context api: a method to share data across the component tree without
   ecplicitly passing props down manually at eveay level.

   ## What I have used for handling and managing data:

   In my project , I have used react context api for handling and managing data
   across different components. the context api allows me to share state between
   components without passing props manually at every level.this is speacially
   helpfull for global state management, like user authentication , thems.
